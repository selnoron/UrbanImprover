# UrbanImprover 

## About the Project
UrbanImprover is a simple app for city crowdfunding. People can collect money to make the city better. For example, to buy new benches, street lights, or playgrounds.

## How it works:
1. **Create a Project:** A user creates a "campaign" (name, money goal, and time).
2. **Help the City:** Other people send money to help the project.
3. **Get Rewards:** When you send ETH, the app automatically gives you **URB tokens**. 
4. **Transparency:** All money and tokens are controlled by smart contracts. No one can steal the funds.

## Tech Stack:
* **Solidity:** For smart contracts.
* **Hardhat:** For testing and deployment.
* **JavaScript:** For the website and MetaMask connection.
* **MetaMask:** To sign transactions.
* **Sepolia:** Our test network.
